Students are encouraged to identify and contact faculty members in their area of interest. At the beginning of each term there will be a Zoom presentation, where faculty will provide a short bio and information on their research. Afterwards, students would need to contact the faculty in the research area of their interest to see if they are a good match. A list of current SFWE faculty, their research areas, and contact information can be found here: SFWE Faculty\n\nOnce the student and a faculty member agree to work together on research, the student should inform the Graduate Program Coordinator of this change.\n\n\nSFWE Graduate Studies Contact Information\nRicardo Valerdi, Director of SIE Graduate Studies \nLiza Soto, Graduate Program Coordinator \nE-mail: sfwe-grad@engr.arizona.edu\n\n1127, E. James E. Rogers Way, Room 111 The University of Arizona\nTucson, AZ – 85721-0020\n\n\nMaster of Science Degrees\nThe MS in Software Engineering is centered around discovery-based education and experiential learning. Students complete design projects and research that emphasize not only development of software engineering solutions, but also, they build experience in communications, teamwork, critical thinking and professionalism. \nMS Degree Requirements\nThe following general degree requirements apply to the SFWE Master of Science.\n\nStudents must earn at least 30 units of graduate credit (courses numbered 5xx, 6xx, 9xx). Credit for SFWE 695A, SFWE 900, and SFWE 920 may not be counted toward the MS degree. No course may be counted toward the requirements for more than two degrees (earned at any institution). For example, an SFWE 5xx course can be counted toward the MS in Software Engineering as well as PhD in SFWE, but it cannot be counted toward a third degree (e.g., MS in another program).\nAll MS students must choose one of the options described below.\n\n\n\nApproved Electives for Software Engineering\n\n\n\n\nMS Plan of Study\nThe Plan of Study is the student's contract with the university regarding specific course requirements that the student must satisfy before becoming eligible for the MS degree. Students should consult with their advisor, Graduate Program Coordinator, and/or the Director of Graduate Studies to identify courses to include in the plan of the study. Students are encouraged to submit a completed plan of study through GradPath before the end of the first year in the program.\nPerformance Requirements: A cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher must be maintained on all coursework taken for graduate credit. A grade of C or higher is required for a course to be used to satisfy the degree requirements (A or B for transfer credits).\nMS Report vs Thesis Option\nMS Thesis Option: Thesis work is designed for students who wish to work with a faculty member on a specific research topic. The thesis is prepared under the guidance of the faculty advisor and is reviewed by an examining committee prior to an oral presentation. As a part of graduation requirements, the thesis must be submitted to the Graduate College for formatting review and publishing in the campus repository. Students wishing to pursue a Doctoral degree are encouraged to choose the thesis option.\nMS Committee for Thesis Option: Students who pursue the MS thesis option are required to have a committee of at least three faculty members, including the faculty advisor who will serve as the chair of the committee. At least two members must be current Graduate Faculty (i.e., tenured, tenure-track, or approved tenure-equivalent faculty member). If the third member is not a Graduate Faculty, they must be approved by the Graduate College as a special member.\nOnce the committee is formed, the student should submit a Committee Appointment form through GradPath.\nA complete draft of the MS Thesis should be shared with all committee members at least two weeks prior to the anticipated defense date.\nHow to identify committee members? The committee for the MS thesis option will ideally include faculty in the student’s area of interest. The faculty advisor may have suggestions on potential committee members.\n\nAccelerated MS Programs\nThe SFWE Accelerated Master’s Program (AMP) is designed to allow exceptional undergraduate seniors at the University of Arizona to work concurrently toward an MS degree. Up to 12 units of approved graduate coursework taken in their undergraduate career may count towards both BS and MS degrees, allowing students to earn their MS degree quicker.\nWhen can undergraduate students apply to the AMP program? Students interested in the program may apply after completion of a minimum of 75 eligible undergraduate credits. The minimum GPA of 3.3 is required at the time of application as per the Graduate College.\nAMP Admission Requirements\nCumulative GPA at the time of admission is 3.3\nA minimum of 90 undergraduate credit hours is required at the time of entry into the AMP\nCompletion of at least 12 earned undergraduate credits in the SFWE major at the University of Arizona (SFEBSSFE). Units still graded Incomplete, units graded Pass/Fail or units taken as audit will not count toward the requirement of the 12 undergraduate units\nAdditional application materials: One letter of recommendation and a statement of purpose. GRE is not required for AMP admission.\nAcademic Policies related to the AMP\nOnce students are admitted to the AMP, they are strongly encouraged to see the SFWE Graduate Program Coordinator and the SFWE Undergraduate Advisor to discuss their plan of study. Students pursuing MS thesis or report plan must select a faculty advisor and submit a preliminary thesis/report proposal and plan of study before the end of the first semester after being admitted to the AMP.\nAMP academic policies and tuition policies are defined by the Graduate College and are described in the General Catalog at https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/accelerated-masters-program-amp#policies.\n\n\nSFWE Doctor of Philosophy\nThe Software Engineering Doctor of Philosophy Program (PhD) is designed for individuals wishing to pursue advanced research and scholarly work.\nDoctoral Coursework and Plan of Study\nThe Plan of Study is the student's contract with the university regarding specific course requirements that the student must satisfy before becoming eligible for the PhD degree. This includes a minimum of 48 units of non-dissertation course work (of which 12 units will be applied to the minor), plus at least 18 units of dissertation research and two units of Graduate Colloquium. \n\n\n\nPerformance Requirements: A cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher must be maintained on all coursework taken for graduate credit. A grade of C or higher is required for a course to be used to satisfy the degree requirements (A or B for transfer credits). Doctoral students are also required to actively participate in and contribute to research activities with mentorship from their faculty advisor. \nCan graduate coursework from a master’s degree be applied toward the PhD degree? With approval from the student’s faculty advisor, graduate coursework applied toward a master’s degree may be applied toward the PhD. Non-coursework credits (e.g., thesis or research credits) from a master's degree cannot be applied toward the PhD degree. Transfer credits are subject to the following restrictions:\nA maximum of 30 units of relevant coursework from another graduate degree may be transferred and applied toward the PhD requirements.\nThe credits must first be reviewed and approved by the student’s faculty advisor.\nThe minimum grade for transferred credits must be an A, B, or the equivalent at the institution where courses were taken.\nParticipation in SFWE Graduate Seminar/Colloquium: Students must take at least two units of SFWE 695A Graduate Seminar. This class will be graded as Pass/Fail. To fulfill this requirement, students must attend the department seminars during each semester where they are enrolled in SFWE 695A. Prior to completing the seminar requirement, the student must also give a research presentation to the class. After completing the seminar requirement, students are highly encouraged to continue attending graduate seminars of interest to their research area.\nAre independent study credits (e.g., SFWE 699) applicable to PhD coursework? Three units of independent investigation may be included in the plan of study, provided the independent study covers a topic not available through regular courses and a detailed course plan is submitted to and approved by the Graduate Studies Committee\nAre SFWE 900 credits applicable to PhD coursework or dissertation research? SFWE 900 research credits may not be counted toward the PhD Degree.\nMinimum registration requirement for funded students: Students funded by the SIE Department are required to be enrolled in at least nine graduate units per semester to maintain their appointment.\n\nDoctoral Minor\nFor SFWE PhD Students: Doctoral students in SFWE are required to choose a minor and minor advisor outside of SFWE and complete 12 units of graduate coursework in the minor department/program. Common minor programs for SFWE students are systems & industrial engineering, computer science, information science, statistics, and other engineering programs (e.g., biomedical, computer, or mechanical engineering). Students can also choose to do a split minor between two programs (6 units in each minor program) or a multidisciplinary minor. The minor advisor typically serves on the student’s comprehensive exam committee. Their participation in the final dissertation committee is at the discretion of the student’s major advisor.\nFor non-SFWE PhD Students: Doctoral students in any department/program outside of SFWE may choose to minor in SFWE. Students intending to minor in SFWE should first identify a SFWE faculty as their minor advisor. \nThe PhD minor in SFWE consists of 12 units of graduate coursework.\n6 units from Core Area Courses\nSFWE 507 – Foundations of Software Engineering\nSFWE 502 – Software DevSecOps\nSFWE 503 – Software Project Management \nSFWE 504 –  Software Requirements Analysis & Testing\nSFWE 505 – Software Architecture & Design\nSFWE 506 – Distributed Computing\n6 units from SFWE-approved electives\nSFWE 501 – Software Assurance\nSFWE 508 – Data Mining\nSFWE 509 – Cloud Computing Principles and Practices\nSFWE 510 – Cloud Native Software Engineering\nSFWE 511 – Software for Industrial Control Systems\nSFWE 512 – Robotics\nSFWE 513 – Software Engineering Research Methods\n A minor that is split between SFWE and another academic department/program requires 6 units of graduate coursework from the SFWE core area courses and 6 units of coursework in the other program. Participation of the SFWE minor advisor in written and oral comprehensive exam and final defense is at discretion of the minor and major advisors.\nDoctoral Qualifying Exam (QE)\nPurpose: The Doctoral Qualifying Examination (QE) aims to evaluate the prerequisite knowledge required to undertake research in the student’s area of interest in Software Engineering, leading to successful completion of the Ph.D.\nThe QE is required to be taken by the student prior to the end of their third semester, and will be administered by a Qualifying Exam Committee (QEC) comprising of at least three and not more than five members of College of Engineering faculty. The QEC will be chaired by the student’s Faculty Advisor, who will work with the student in identifying the rest of the QEC. The content of the QE will be based on graduate level courses in software engineering and related disciplines based on each individual student’s plan of study.\nThe content of each doctoral student’s QEC will be submitted by their advisor for approval by the Director of SFWE Graduate Studies Committee one month prior to scheduling the exam. Once the QEC is approved, the student should schedule this QE at a suitable time for the Committee with the assistance of the Graduate Program Coordinator. The student is allowed to request meetings with the QEC members in advance to discuss the scope of the exam, and the appropriate review topics.\nThe QE will be a closed session (not open to public) exam administered by the QEC through a combination of oral/written questions on topics priorly identified to the student. The exam is required to be at least forty-five minutes in duration and cannot last more than three hours. \nEvaluation: At the end of the exam, the committee will vote if the student passed or failed in a secret ballot administered by the chair of the QEC. The majority of the QEC voting a fail vote will result in failure in the exam, wherein abstaining to vote equates to a Negative vote. The results of the exam will be provided by the QEC chair to the SFWE Graduate Studies Committee.\nStudents failing the QE the first time are allowed a second and last attempt in the following semester. The QEC for the second attempt can request access to the results of the first QE and is required to have at least one member from the first QEC. can retake the exam for the second time.\nFailure to pass the QE on the second attempt will result in the removal of the student from the SFWE PhD program.\nDoctoral Comprehensive Exam\nPurpose: The purpose of the comprehensive examination is to determine whether the student has developed sufficient background and expertise for research in the field of their planned dissertation. Successful completion of the examination leads to formal admission to PhD candidacy.\nFormat: This exam includes written and oral portions covering the major and minor areas of the student. Shortly after successful completion of the written portion, an oral exam is conducted by a committee appointed by the Dean of the Graduate College in consultation with the department.\nWritten Comprehensive Exam: The student will send a summary of the dissertation proposal to the committee when they are ready for taking the comprehensive exam. Each committee member will then develop a set of questions related to the student’s area of specialization and, when appropriate, on any aspect of the student’s proposed dissertation. The nature and type of questions as well as the timeline for the student to respond to the questions (e.g., few weeks to a month) are up to each committee member.\n\nOral Comprehensive Exam: After completing all written portions, the student can schedule an oral exam with the committee. The oral exam typically includes a presentation based on the proposed dissertation research.\nTiming: The comprehensive exam is typically taken at least a semester to a year before the final dissertation defense. It is recommended that the comprehensive exam is taken at least nine months before the final defense.\nEvaluation: Students are evaluated on their ability to formulate and analyze research problems using theory and methods from their major and minor areas of specialization as well as their written and oral communication.\nFor the written comprehensive exam, each committee member will assess the outcome as pass or fail. A committee member may ask for clarifications or revisions to the written exam once. Satisfactory response to all questions from each committee member constitutes a pass in the written exam.\nFor oral comprehensive exam, each committee member will assess three areas (extent of pertinent literature review and analyses; depth and originality of research problem and methods; communication) on a scale of 1 to 5. A score of 3 or above on all three areas from all committee members is considered as pass. When the student passes the oral comprehensive exam, they are recommended to the Graduate College for acceptance as a PhD candidate. At the discretion of the committee, the student may repeat the oral comprehensive exam once within four months, incorporating specific recommendations from committee members.\nComprehensive Exam Committee: The committee must consist of a minimum of four members, of which one member must be a minor representative. Three members, including their major and minor advisors, must be current tenured, or tenure track faculty members or approved tenure equivalent. The fourth member may be an approved special member. The minor faculty advisor may choose to waive the written portion of the exam but is required to participate in the oral comprehensive exam.\nDoctoral Final Exam: Written Dissertation and Final Oral Defense Exam\nPurpose: The purpose the doctoral final exam is to assess the merit and contributions of the candidate’s doctoral research. This doctoral final exam is a culmination of the candidate’s original research conducted during their PhD program.\nFormat: There are two components to the doctoral final exam: a written dissertation and a final oral defense of their dissertation.\nWritten Dissertation: The candidate should develop a written document that demonstrates all aspects of their research including significance of the work, a detailed review of relevant literature, methodologies employed and/or developed, significant findings from the work, a critical discussion of the findings, limitations, and the impact, and potential for future research. The specific format of written dissertation is defined by the faculty advisor. General formatting guidelines are provided by\n\nthe Graduate College: https://grad.arizona.edu/gsas/dissertations-theses/dissertation-and-thesis- formatting-guides\nFinal Oral Defense: When the doctoral candidate has met the rigor and standards of scholarship and has documented the research in a dissertation, the candidate will publicly defend the dissertation and answer any general questions related to their work. The exact time and place of the oral defense must be announced publicly at least two weeks in advance of the oral defense. The oral defense is facilitated by a faculty committee appointed by the Dean of the Graduate College in consultation with the major department and chaired by the faculty advisor. The presentation portion of the oral defense is open to the public. Following the public presentation and discussion, the candidate will participate in a closed meeting with the committee for further evaluation.\nTiming: The oral defense can be scheduled when both the candidate and faculty advisor agree that the proposed dissertation research is complete, rigorous, and of high quality. The written dissertation should be complete at the time of scheduling the oral defense. An electronic version of the dissertation should be shared with all committee members at least two weeks prior to the oral defense date. Additionally, an Announcement of Oral Examination Form should be completed and submitted via GradPath at least two weeks (i.e., 10 business days) prior to the oral defense date.\nEvaluation: The dissertation committee will assess the originality, merit, and contributions of the candidate’s research. This includes their ability to (a) identify and critically evaluate relevant literature,\n(b) formulate and solve original problems using SFWE methods, and (c) interpret and communicate research ideas and findings. Further guidelines for the oral defense are provided by the Graduate College: https://arizona.app.box.com/v/grad-gsas-finaldefnsinstr\n\nDissertation Committee: The committee must consist of a minimum of three faculty members, all of whom must be current University of Arizona faculty members that are either tenured, tenure-track, or approved as tenure equivalent. Fourth and any additional committee members can be tenured or tenure- track or approved special members. All dissertation committee members are expected to attend the entire final defense.\n\nResources and Academic Policies for SIE Graduate Students\nGrievance Procedures\nA graduate student with any type of grievance should first communicate with their faculty advisor or Director of SFWE Graduate Studies, depending on who is more appropriate from the student’s view.

Introduction\nWelcome to the Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering (SIE) at the University of the Arizona!\nFounded in 1961 as the nation’s first systems engineering academic program, the SIE department is\ncommitted to providing a welcoming learning and research environment and a comprehensive\nundergraduate curriculum leading to bachelor of science degrees in systems engineering, industrial\nengineering, and engineering management. The Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering program,\nBachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering program, and Bachelor of Science in Engineering\nManagement program are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,\nwww.abet.org. The department offers three MS degrees: Systems Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and\nEngineering Management. At the doctoral level, the department offers a research-intensive PhD in Systems\nand Industrial Engineering.\nThe purpose of this handbook is to serve as a guide for current undergraduate students on requirements\nfor completing SIE undergraduate programs.\n\n1\n\n\f2. SIE Undergraduate Studies Administration\nThe following are key contacts of individuals who will support students in their SIE undergraduate studies.\n\nMajor Academic Advisor\nEmail correspondence can be sent to advisor@sie.arizona.edu. Students are responsible for checking their\nCatmail daily for important updates, announcements, deadlines, and opportunities. This can\nbe supplemented by joining UArizonaSIE Discord server and following our SIE Instagram and\nLinkedIn. During fall/spring semesters, newsletters will be sent at least 1-2 times with any other\nnecessary emails in between.\nAcademic Advising is a collaborative relationship between the student and academic advisor. The intent\nof the collaboration is to assist the student in developing educational and career goals. Academic advisors\nassist and support the student in progressing toward the appropriate degree. Academic advisors provide\nacademic assistance and individualized attention to promote each student's success at the University of\nArizona. An academic advisor can share knowledge, experience and insight that is beneficial to the student.\nThe advisor's role is to help the student evaluate and realize educational and career options. This requires\nthe advisor to:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\napprove the student's academic program of study\nprovide accurate and consistent information\nclarify program requirements, policies and procedures\nassist the student in identifying appropriate institutional resources\nfacilitate relationships between the student and other individuals on campus who may provide\nassistance\nuphold the academic standards of the institution\n\nA key tenet of academic advising is that the student is responsible for his or her own decisions. Academic\nadvisors exist because students require information and assistance to navigate the university system and\nto make appropriate decisions. The student's role is to explore academic, career and personal goals. This\nrequires the student to:\n• seek advising from appropriate advisors at appropriate times\n• learn academic program requirements\n• utilize available resources, including those that are web-based, to monitor academic progress\n• take responsibility for actions and decisions that affect academic progress\n• be engaged\nRequired Meetings with Major Academic Advisor:\nStudents can schedule Zoom or in-person advising appointments through Trellis Advise,\nUAccess>Advising>Trellis Advise. The meetings listed here are required:\n• Once admitted into SIE major to remove advising hold in UAccess\n• Semester before enrollment in upper division courses/applying for advanced standing\n• Semester before you are ready to graduate to complete your final degree audit\n• Each semester prior to Priority Registration (strongly recommended)\n\n2\n\n\fDirector of BS Programs\nDirector, Industrial Engineering, Dr. Pavlo Krokhmal (email: krokhmal@arizona.edu)\nDirector, Systems Engineering, Dr. Alejandro Salado (email: alejandrosalado@arizona.edu)\nDirector, Engineering Management, Dr. Michael Kwinn (email: kwinnm@arizona.edu)\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Jianqiang Cheng (email: jqcheng@arizona.edu)\n\nFaculty Advisor\nUpon arriving at the University of Arizona, students are assigned a faculty advisor based on their major.\nYour faculty advisor is there to offer you their perspective and expertise regarding careers, graduate school,\nresearch, and approval of directed research or internships. A list of current SIE faculty, their research areas,\nand contact information can be found here: https://sie.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty.\n\n3. BS Degree Requirements\nSIE programs offer unique combinations of technical knowledge, communication skills, teamwork and\nleadership experience. SIE programs focus on the skills needed in every industry to design and refine\ncomplex systems and to prepare individuals for professional work in systems, industrial, and engineering\nmanagement.\nThe following general degree requirement applies to undergraduate programs in systems engineering,\nindustrial engineering, and engineering management. It is the student’s responsibility to review their\nAdvisement Report in UAccess with their academic advisor to ensure satisfaction of graduation\nrequirements.\n•\n\nStudents must earn a minimum of 128 credits for degree.

Accelerated MS Programs\nThe SIE Accelerated Master’s Program (AMP) is designed to allow exceptional undergraduate seniors at\nthe University of Arizona to work concurrently toward an MS degree. Up to 12 units of approved graduate\ncoursework taken in their undergraduate career may count towards both BS and MS degrees, allowing\nstudents to earn their MS degree quicker.\nWhen can undergraduate students apply to the AMP program? Students interested in the program may\napply after completion of a minimum of 75 eligible undergraduate credits. The minimum GPA of 3.3 is\nrequired at the time of application as per the Graduate College.\nAMP Admission Requirements:\n•\n\nCumulative GPA at the time of admission is 3.3\n\n•\n\nA minimum of 90 undergraduate credit hours is required at the time of entry into the AMP\n\n•\n\nCompletion of at least 12 earned undergraduate credits in their SIE major at the University of Arizona.\nUnits still graded Incomplete, units graded Pass/Fail or units taken as audit will not count toward the\nrequirement of the 12 undergraduate units\n\n•\n\nStudents should have taken the following MS prerequisite courses. Courses equivalent to these\nprerequisites taken at other departments or institutions will be allowed.\no\n\nSIE 305: Introduction to Probability and Statistics\n\no\n\nSIE 340: Deterministic Operations Research\n\no\n•\n\nSIE 321: Probabilistic Models in Operations Research (optional for MS in EMG students)\n\nAdditional application materials: Three letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose and a\nCV/Resume. GRE is not required for AMP admission.\n\nAcademic Policies related to the AMP:\n•\n\nOnce students are admitted to the AMP, they are strongly encouraged to see the Graduate Program\nCoordinator and the SIE Undergraduate Advisor to discuss their plan of study. Students pursuing MS\nthesis or report plan must select a faculty advisor and submit a preliminary thesis/report proposal and\nplan of study before the end of the first semester after being admitted to the AMP.\n\n•\n\nSIE 500 level courses that are convened with 400 level courses and their 400 level courses are required\nfor a BS degree cannot be counted toward an MS degree. For example, if a student is enrolled in the BS\nin Industrial Engineering (INE) program, SIE 531 cannot be counted toward the student’s MS INE\ndegree as SIE 431 is required for the BS INE program. However, if a student is enrolled in the BS in\nSystems Engineering (SYE) program, SIE 530 can be counted toward both the BS SYE and MS SYE as\nSIE 430 is not required for the BS SYE.\nAMP academic policies and tuition policies are defined by the Graduate College and are described in\nthe General Catalog at https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/accelerated-masters-program-amp#policies.\n\nPerformance Requirements: A cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher must be maintained on all coursework\ntaken for graduate credit. A grade of C or higher is required for a course to be used to satisfy the degree\nrequirements (A or B for transfer credits).\n\n5\n\n\f5.
