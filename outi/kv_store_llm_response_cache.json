    "return": "To assess whether your current GPA meets the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards at the University of Arizona, let's break down the requirements based on the information provided.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is a minimum requirement to maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA across all courses taken during your undergraduate studies for satisfactory academic progress to be met.\r\n\r\nGiven that you have a GPA of 2.85, this indicates that your current cumulative GPA falls below the minimum threshold required for satisfactory progress. The University requires that students achieve at least a 3.0 GPA on their overall transcript.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the GPA requirement, there are provisions in place to address situations where a student does not meet SAP due to extenuating circumstances or other justifiable reasons:\r\n\r\n1. **Probation**: If you fail to maintain this minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA, you will be placed on academic probation for one semester. During this period, you would need to meet with your faculty advisor and the Graduate Program Coordinator to discuss strategies for improving your academic standing.\r\n\r\n2. **Academic Disqualification**: Should your GPA remain below 3.0 after one semester in probation status, further action might include academic disqualification. You can continue studying under probation by getting approval from the Graduate College upon presenting a justification waiver.\r\n\r\nTo avoid being placed on academic probation or undergoing academic disqualification, you should aim to raise your cumulative GPA back to at least a 3.0 as soon as possible. It is advisable to consult with your faculty advisor and the Graduate Program Coordinator for advice tailored to your specific situation and any available resources that might help you achieve academic success.\r\n\r\nIt's crucial to note that maintaining good academic standing throughout your undergraduate program not only ensures eligibility for graduation but also opens up opportunities such as scholarships, fellowships, and assistantships, which typically require satisfactory academic progress.",

    "return": "To determine if you meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements at the University of Arizona with a GPA of 2.85, it depends on your specific academic standing and any potential waivers or extensions that may apply.\r\n\r\nThe university requires a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00 to maintain satisfactory progress in most graduate programs. With a GPA of 2.85, you are below the threshold for an automatic SAP failure. However, there are provisions for students who fall short of this requirement:\r\n\r\n1. **First Semester on Academic Probation**: If your cumulative GPA drops below 3.0 during your first semester, you will be placed on academic probation for one semester.\r\n\r\n2. **Mentoring Plan Development**: While on probation, you should develop a mentoring plan in collaboration with your faculty advisor and the Graduate Program Coordinator to identify strategies to improve your academic performance.\r\n\r\n3. **Cumulative GPA Requirement**: To avoid being academically disqualified, your cumulative GPA must be raised above 3.0 by the end of your first semester on probation. If this is not achieved, further actions may include:\r\n\r\n   - **Academic Disqualification**: You might face academic disqualification if after one semester you do not raise your GPA to at least a 3.0.\r\n\r\n4. **Justification Waivers**: In some cases, if there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., health issues, family emergencies), you may be eligible for a justification waiver allowing you an additional semester to improve your academic standing with the approval of the Graduate College and the Graduate Program Coordinator.\r\n\r\n5. **Continuous Progress**: It's essential to consult regularly with your faculty advisor and Graduate Program Coordinator during this period to ensure continuous progress towards meeting the 3.0 GPA requirement.\r\n\r\nIn summary, a GPA of 2.85 does not meet Satisfactory Academic Progress for most graduate programs at the University of Arizona. You are advised to address your academic performance through targeted efforts guided by your faculty advisor and Graduate Program Coordinator while on probation to avoid further academic sanctions.",
